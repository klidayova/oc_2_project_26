# Project #26: Ultrastructural protein mapping through Correlation of Light and Electron Microscopy


<!-- [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/)](https://doi.org/) -->

This repo was created by the [AI4Life project](https://ai4life.eurobioimaging.eu) using data provided by Jan van der Beek at Center for Molecular Medicine, Utrecht.

# Introduction
The project aims to achieve an accurate automatic correlation of light and electron microscopy images. The combination of multi-channel protein labeling through fluorescence microscopy with nm-scale ultrastructural morphology from electron microscopy can provide both molecular and ultrastructural information of endo-lysosomal alternations at high resolution.

## Installation
Install the [conda](https://conda.io) package, dependency and environment manager.

You can download this repository from the green `Code` button → download ZIP, or clone through the command line with

    cd <path to any folder of choice>
    git clone https://github.com/BIIFSweden/AI4Life_OC2_2024_26.git

Then create the `AI4Life_OC2_2024_26` conda environment:

    cd <path to your 'AI4Life_OC2_2024_26' directory>
    conda env create -f environment.yml

This will install all necessary project dependencies.

## Usage
Copy all project data to the [data](data) directory (or use symbolic links).

Then run [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org) from within the `AI4Life_OC2_2024_26` conda environment:

    cd <path to your 'AI4Life_OC2_2024_26' directory>
    conda activate AI4Life_OC2_2024_26
    jupyter-lab

Inside the `notebooks` folder you will find notebooks for:

- [Detecting the fiducial particles in EM images](notebooks/Detect_fiducial_particles_in_EM.ipynb)
- [Detecting the fiducial particles in LM images](notebooks/Detect_fiducial_particles_in_LM.ipynb)
